# Usage Guide for `download_tcga_slides_by_type_and_projects.py`

This guide explains how to use the `download_tcga_slides_by_type_and_projects.py` script to download metadata and optionally tissue slides, diagnostic slides, or both from TCGA projects via the GDC API, with the ability to filter by specific patient IDs. The script dynamically fetches all TCGA projects with slide images, organizes data by patient, and generates CSV summaries for each project and a combined summary for all projects.

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.6+**: Ensure Python is installed.
- **Required Libraries**: Install the necessary Python libraries using:
  ```bash
  pip install requests tenacity pandas
  ```
- **Internet Access**: Required to query the GDC API and download files.
- **Storage Space**: If downloading slides, ensure sufficient disk space (slides can be large, e.g., ~1TB for TCGA-BRCA).

## Script Overview

The script downloads metadata and optionally slide images (SVS format) for TCGA projects with slide images (e.g., TCGA-BLCA, TCGA-BRCA, TCGA-CESC, TCGA-COAD, TCGA-LUAD, TCGA-LUSC, TCGA-PAAD, TCGA-PRAD, TCGA-READ, TCGA-SKCM, TCGA-STAD, TCGA-UCEC, TCGA-UVM, and others), organizes them by patient (using `case_id` or `cases.submitter_id`), and supports filtering by patient IDs. It generates:
- Per-project CSV summaries (`tcga_data/<project_id>_summary.csv`) with total patients, total slides, tissue slides, diagnostic slides, size (MB), file formats, and per-patient details.
- A single summary CSV (`tcga_data/all_tcga_projects_summary.csv`) aggregating data across all specified projects.
- A log file (`tcga_download_log.txt`) capturing all output and errors.

## Usage Instructions

1. **Save the Script**:
   - Save the script as `download_tcga_slides_by_type_and_projects.py` in your working directory.

2. **Prepare Patient IDs (Optional)**:
   - **CSV File**: Create a CSV file (e.g., `patient_ids.csv`) with a `Patient ID` column containing patient IDs (e.g., `TCGA-XX-XXXX`). This can be sourced from `common_patients_<project>.csv` or `TCGA-<project>_summary.csv` files generated by related scripts. Example:
     ```csv
     Patient ID
     TCGA-A1-XXXX
     TCGA-A2-YYYY
     ```
   - **Comma-Separated String**: List patient IDs directly, e.g., `TCGA-XX-XXXX,TCGA-YY-YYYY`.
   - If no patient IDs are provided, the script processes all patients for the specified projects.

3. **Run the Script**:
   - Use the command line with the following arguments:
     - `--download-type`: Specifies what to download:
       - `tissue`: Download tissue slides and metadata.
       - `diagnostic`: Download diagnostic slides and metadata.
       - `both`: Download both tissue and diagnostic slides and metadata.
       - `none`: Download metadata only.
     - `--projects`: Specifies TCGA projects to process:
       - `all`: Process all TCGA projects with slide images (dynamically fetched from the GDC API, e.g., TCGA-BLCA, TCGA-BRCA, TCGA-CESC, etc.).
       - A single project ID (e.g., `TCGA-BLCA`).
       - Comma-separated project IDs (e.g., `TCGA-BLCA,TCGA-BRCA,TCGA-CESC`).
     - `--patient-ids`: Filters downloads to specific patients:
       - Path to a CSV file with a `Patient ID` column (e.g., `patient_ids.csv`).
       - Comma-separated patient IDs (e.g., `TCGA-XX-XXXX,TCGA-YY-YYYY`).
       - Omit to process all patients.

   **Examples**:
   - Download tissue slides and metadata for specific patients in TCGA-BLCA using a CSV file:
     ```bash
     python download_tcga_slides_by_type_and_projects.py --download-type tissue --projects TCGA-BLCA --patient-ids patient_ids.csv
     ```
   - Download both tissue and diagnostic slides for specific patients across TCGA-BRCA and TCGA-CESC using a comma-separated string:
     ```bash
     python download_tcga_slides_by_type_and_projects.py --download-type both --projects TCGA-BRCA,TCGA-CESC --patient-ids TCGA-A1-XXXX,TCGA-A2-YYYY
     ```
   - Download diagnostic slides and metadata for all patients in all TCGA projects with slide images:
     ```bash
     python download_tcga_slides_by_type_and_projects.py --download-type diagnostic --projects all
     ```
   - Download metadata only for a specific patient in TCGA-UVM:
     ```bash
     python download_tcga_slides_by_type_and_projects.py --download-type none --projects TCGA-UVM --patient-ids TCGA-ZZ-ZZZZ
     ```

4. **Output**:
   - **Metadata**: Saved in `tcga_data/metadata/<project_id>/<patient_identifier>.json`.
   - **Slides** (if downloaded): Saved in `tcga_data/slides/<project_id>/<patient_identifier>/`.
   - **Per-Project CSV**: Saved as `tcga_data/<project_id>_summary.csv` with:
     - Project ID, total patients, total slides, tissue slides, diagnostic slides, total size (MB), file formats.
     - Per-patient details: patient ID, number of slides, tissue slides, diagnostic slides, size (MB).
   - **All Projects CSV**: Saved as `tcga_data/all_tcga_projects_summary.csv` with one row per project, including project ID, total patients, total slides, tissue slides, diagnostic slides, total size (MB), and file formats.
   - **Log File**: Saved as `tcga_download_log.txt`, capturing all output and errors for debugging.

## Notes
- **Dynamic Project List**: The script fetches all TCGA projects with slide images from the GDC API (e.g., TCGA-BLCA, TCGA-BRCA, TCGA-CESC, TCGA-COAD, TCGA-LUAD, TCGA-LUSC, TCGA-PAAD, TCGA-PRAD, TCGA-READ, TCGA-SKCM, TCGA-STAD, TCGA-UCEC, TCGA-UVM, and others). The exact list is logged in `tcga_download_log.txt`.
- **Patient IDs**: Use IDs from `common_patients_<project>.csv` or `TCGA-<project>_summary.csv` (column `Patient ID`, e.g., `TCGA-XX-XXXX`). The script matches against `case_id` or `cases.submitter_id` from the GDC API. If "Unknown" IDs appear, itâ€™s due to missing identifiers in the GDC API; cross-reference with cBioPortal or contact GDC support.
- **CSV Format**: The `--patient-ids` CSV file must have a `Patient ID` column. Other columns are ignored. Ensure IDs match the GDC API format (e.g., `TCGA-XX-XXXX`).
- **Checksum Verification**: The script skips downloading files that exist with matching MD5 checksums, ensuring no redundant downloads.
- **Retry Logic**: Failed downloads (e.g., due to connection issues) are retried up to 3 times with exponential backoff.
- **Slide Dimensions**: Not available in GDC metadata. Use OpenSlide to extract dimensions from downloaded SVS files.
- **Large Downloads**: Downloading slides (especially with `--download-type both` or `--projects all`) may require significant time and storage due to large file sizes.

## Troubleshooting
- **Connection Errors**: Check `tcga_download_log.txt` for details on failed downloads. The script retries up to 3 times for network issues. Ensure a stable internet connection or consider the GDC Data Transfer Tool for bulk downloads.
- **CSV File Errors**: Ensure the CSV file has a `Patient ID` column. Errors are logged in `tcga_download_log.txt`.
- **Invalid Projects**: If a provided project ID is invalid, the script lists all available projects in the error message. Check `tcga_download_log.txt` for the fetched project list.
- **Missing Slides**: If no slides are found for specified patient IDs or projects, a warning is logged, and an empty summary CSV is generated. Verify patient IDs and project availability on the GDC Data Portal (https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/projects).
- **Storage Issues**: Monitor disk space when downloading slides. Use `--download-type none` to assess sizes first.
